## Compiled vs Intrepeted

**Compiled** -  C++, Typescript, C#
finds errors before running code
1. source code
2. translated/compiler source code to machine code
3. run-time

**Intrepeted** - JS, Python, Ruby, PHP 
JS runs code line by line until it runs into error
1. source code
2. run-time: interpreter (node/python3) translate and executes

## Browser engines - chrome, microsoft edge, opera uses chrome V8 is a chromium JS interpreter 

## Typing - set of rules that applies "type" to data structures
- JS: primitives (boolean, num, string, symbol, null, undefined, bigint)
      nonprimitive (object/mapping, array/sequence)
- Python: primitives (integers, float, strings, boolean)
          nonprimitive (arrays/sequence, lists/sequence, tuples/sequence, dictionary/mapping, sets, files)

## Statically v Dynamically typed languages
- Statically: types checked before run-time
    Java, Typescript, C++ 
- Dynamically: types check during run-time
    JS, Python
